# 📖 Introduction - Communication Library Fundamentals
[English | [日本語](docs_jp/md_manual_introduction_jp.html)]

## 🌟 Welcome to the World of Inter-Process Communication!

**Shared Memory Based Handy Communication Manager** is a comprehensive library collection that makes inter-process communication easy to implement. With this library, you can achieve complex communication processing with just a few lines of code.

## 🤔 What is Inter-Process Communication?

### Understanding Through Familiar Examples

Inter-process communication means **different programs exchanging information with each other**.

```
📱 Smartphone Example
┌─────────────────┐    Data    ┌─────────────────┐
│   Camera App    │ ────────────▶ │ Photo Edit App  │
│ (Capture Data)  │              │ (Processing)    │
└─────────────────┘              └─────────────────┘

🏭 Factory Example  
┌─────────────────┐  Sensor Data ┌─────────────────┐
│ Sensor Monitor  │ ────────────▶ │ Control System  │
│   Program       │              │   Program       │
└─────────────────┘              └─────────────────┘
```

### Why is Inter-Process Communication Necessary?

**🔹 Efficiency Through Division of Labor**
- Each program focuses on specialized processing
- Development, maintenance, and testing become easier

**🔹 Improved Stability**  
- One program crashing doesn't affect others
- Partial updates and restarts are possible

**🔹 Scalability**
- Adjust number of processes according to processing capacity
- Distributed processing across multiple computers

## 🧠 Problems This Library Solves

### Traditional Challenges
```cpp
// ❌ Traditional method: Complex and dangerous
void* shared_mem = mmap(NULL, size, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_SHARED, fd, 0);
int* data = reinterpret_cast<int*>(shared_mem);  // Dangerous type conversion
pthread_mutex_lock(&mutex);                      // Manual mutual exclusion
*data = 42;
pthread_mutex_unlock(&mutex);
munmap(shared_mem, size);                        // Manual memory management
```

### Our Library's Solution
```cpp
// ✅ Our library: Simple and safe
Publisher<int> pub("my_topic");
pub.publish(42);  // That's all!
```

## 🚀 Features of the Communication Method

**Use Case**: Real-time communication within the same PC

| Library | Features | Applications |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| **shm_pub_sub** | 📡 Publisher/Subscriber model<br>⚡ Microsecond-level ultra-low latency | Robot control, real-time image processing |

> **Note**: v1.x also provided `shm_service` (request-response) and `shm_action`
> (asynchronous processing). They had no users and carried unresolved safety issues,
> so they were removed in v2.0.0. Build request-response and long-running task
> management in a higher layer instead.

```cpp
// Example: Robot sensor data distribution
Publisher<SensorData> sensor_pub("robot_sensors");
sensor_pub.publish(sensor_reading);  // Ultra-fast distribution
```

## 🛠️ Development History and Design Philosophy

### 🏛️ Library Lineage

This library is based on a C library created by **Professor Koichi Ozaki** for robot development in his laboratory.

**Evolution Process**:
```
🕰️ Initial version (C language)
   ↓ Feature additions and improvements
🔧 C++ version (Object-oriented)
```

### 🎯 Design Philosophy

**1. 🎛️ Simple API**
```cpp
// Data transmission (publish) example
Publisher<int> pub("topic");
pub.publish(42);
```

**2. 🔒 Safety**
- Type-safe template design
- Automatic memory management
- Proper error handling through exceptions

**3. 🚀 Performance**
- Zero-copy design (shared memory)
- Efficient data structures (ring buffers)
- Minimal overhead

**4. 🔧 Extensibility and Compatibility**
- **ROS-compatible API**: Intuitive design based on ROS concepts
- **Custom data types**: Support for arbitrary C++ structures
- **Python bindings**: Same API for C++ and Python
- **Platform support**: Linux, Windows (WSL) support
- **Compiler support**: GCC, Clang, MSVC support

## 🎓 API Design Features

### Organization by Namespaces

```cpp
// Shared memory communication
namespace irlab::shm {
    Publisher<T>, Subscriber<T>         // Pub/Sub model
}

// Common base functionality
namespace irlab::shm_base {
    // Shared memory foundation features (memory mapping, mutual exclusion, etc.)
}
```

### Consistent Design Patterns

**🔹 Sender side**: Naming pattern for data senders
- `Publisher` (publishes data)

**🔹 Receiver side**: Naming pattern for data receivers  
- `Subscriber` (subscribes to data)

### Automatic Resource Management

```cpp
{
    Publisher<int> pub("topic");  // ← Automatically allocates memory
    pub.publish(42);
    // ← Resources automatically released when leaving scope
}
// No memory leaks!
```
